# Arkyros

Arkyros is an open-world fighting game created by ReWired 722, a team of high school game developers. 

I was the cofounder and production manager for RW722, meaning I was responsible for overseeing the quality of the codebase as a whole and ensuring all features worked as they were supposed to. Additionally, I was the enemies team manager, which was responsible for implementing all unique enemy behaviors including navigating the terrain, searching for the player, and various enemy attacks.
